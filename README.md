date      |   notes
----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/09/25  |  set up initial environment: canvas, button to record habits put into entry field and title + welcome message.
13/09/25  |  separated front and back end logic (modular design ! :3). also stored inputted habits into a list to be accessed later. 
16/09/25  |  revamped the UI so that it's suitable for 1920x1080 display. This made it look much cleaner. Also researched more into proper tkinter usage and have actually started using labels, frames etc. properly.
30/09/25  |   rows of circles added per habit added to tracker. circles have random colours assigned to them and turn green when clicked and back to og colour when clicked again. will work on adding days of week on top of circles and save files.
